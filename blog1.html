    <div class="blogcom">
        <p style="padding: 0.5% 0.5%;font-size: 25px;">Mental health comprises our emotional, psychological, and social
            security. It impacts how we think, feel, and act. It also helps conclude how we manage stress, relate to
            others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every phase of life, from childhood and adolescence
            through middle age.

            According to the World Health Organization (WHO): ‚ÄúMental health is a state of well-being in which an
            individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work
            productively, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.‚Äù

            Over the course of one‚Äôs life, if one experiences mental health problems, one‚Äôs thinking, attitude, and
            behaviour could be impacted. Many aspects contribute to mental health problems, including:</p>
        <ul style="font-size: 25px;">
            <li>Biological factors, such as genetic factor or brain chemistry</li>
            <li>Life experiences, such as trauma or exploitation</li>
            <li>Family history of mental health issues</li>
        </ul>


        <p style="padding: 0.5% 0.5%;font-size: 25px;">The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a lot of mental health
            issues and they impact not only those who get the disease and those who treat it but also the general
            population, comprising essential workers and those sheltering in place. Anxiety, stress and depression had
            all been rising concerns before the pandemic and recently there was another very material problem adding to
            that list ‚Äî caution fatigue.</p>
