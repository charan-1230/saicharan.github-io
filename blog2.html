        <p style="padding: 0.5% 0.5%;font-size: 25px;">In our increasingly industrialised and mechanical world, I think
            it‚Äôs more important than ever to take note of those moments when nature displays its simple yet spectacular
            beauty to us.

            It‚Äôs simple because a lot of nature‚Äôs wonders are everyday occurrences that we can witness just by going
            outside and being a bit more observant than usual. But it‚Äôs also spectacular because it‚Äôs sometimes
            unbelievable just how wonderful it can be to witness these beautiful events and fully be present for them.
            Connecting with nature uplifts the soul and can help to brighten your entire outlook.

            Even in urban environments, there are still many opportunities to observe the beauty of nature. It can be
            even more wonderful to find something amazing where you would least expect it. For example, this rainbow
            that I observed recently above some busy, traffic-filled roads.</p>

        <p style="padding: 0.5% 0.5%;font-size: 25px;"> Life can get so busy and hectic sometimes that we might not
            think to take the time to pause and look up at
            the sky. To marvel at the magnificence of the moon and the stars that decorate the night, or the clouds that
            softly drift and part to reveal a brilliant sun.

            We might not think to stop on our walk to work to literally ‚Äòsmell the flowers‚Äô ‚Äì to enjoy the scents that
            surround us and think how they are different maybe to the scents we encounter at other times of the year.
            The seasons are changing and there are new plants growing. There are animals that are scampering around and
            gathering food for the colder weather.</p>
